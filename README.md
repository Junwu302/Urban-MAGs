# Urban-MAGs
Urban MAGs were generated using 3,741 metagenome samples obtained from 58 cities worldwide, Metagenomes were assembled with  metaSPAdes and MAGs were constructed by binning contigs per-sample using MetaBAT2.

<b>High quality MAGs (N=1,448)</b>

* High quality MAGs meet the following criterea:
	*  \> 90% estimated completeness
	*  < 5% estimated contamination
	*  < 0.5% estimated strain heterogeneity
	*  \> 50 QS=completeness - 5×contamination

<b>Medium quality MAGs (N=4,532)</b>  
* Medium quality MAGs meet the following criterea:
	*  \>50% estimated completeness
	*  < 5% estimated contamination
	*  \> 50 QS=completeness - 5×contamination
